It is beyond amazing that The Denver Post would publish a column supporting violent protest such as that by Mimi Madrid.

Her taking of Martin Luther King’s statement that “Urban riots must be recognized as durable social phenomena” out of its context and promoting it as an example to be followed can only be considered as a solicitation to further violence.

Her contention that property is not deserving of protection can only be construed as an invitation to anarchy.

Even Facebook had the good sense to shut down the accounts of militia groups. I would expect no less from The Denver Post in regard to provocateurs such as Madrid.
Mimi Madrid writes, don’t decry the “rioters.” Apparently, Martin Luther King, near the end of his life, referred to urban riots as the “language of the unheard.” But nowhere in the text, quoted by Madrid, does he support riots. I came of age in the ’60s and King did not advocate riots. His tools were non-violent protest and civil disobedience.

For eight long minutes, we all watched a cop kill George Floyd with a knee on his neck. The
immediate reaction in Colorado was peaceful protests by
thousands at the state capitol followed by a sweeping police reform bill passed by the Colorado legislature and signed into law by Gov. Jared Polis.

The bill focused on saving lives. The rioters in Denver focused on destruction of property. Rioters in Denver carry lasers and slingshots to injure police,
 bottles of gasoline to start fires, and axes and hammers.

In a Fox News “Media Buzz” interview, Trump 2020 Press Communications Director Erin Perrine hit out at The Atlantic's use of anonymous sources in a report claiming President Trump disparaged fallen U.S. soldiers.

Perrine said it’s “really clear that The Atlantic sources are lying,” citing current and former administration officials who have gone on the record to deny the article.

“There's White House emails that prove that this story is false and you have eight people of the 10 that have gone on the record with direct, firsthand knowledge,” she said. “These aren't sources. These are people who were really there and are out there saying that this is false.”

“I think it's pretty clear here that journalism was abandoned, that journalistic integrity has to be in question here when you have four off-the-record, anonymous sources who are trying to hide their identities instead of standing up to level such 
disgusting accusations against the president of the United States,” Perrine said....

President Donald Trump traveled to battleground Florida Tuesday for an event touting his environmental accomplishments, even as his administration has worked extensively to dismantle key environmental protections.

Trump delivered the remarks at the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse and Museum in Jupiter, Florida, just north of his private club, Mar-a-Lago, located in Palm Beach.
The trip, Trump's 11th visit to Florida this year, according to deputy press secretary Judd Deere, was billed as outlining the administration's "continued conservation and environmental protection efforts in the region,
" citing the Great American Outdoors Act and "funding of countless environmental restoration projects."
But the Trump administration has also taken detailed steps to slash environmental regulations over the last three and a half years. Those changes include pulling out of the landmark Paris climate accords, rolling back regulations on carbon emission standards for
 coal-fired power plants, the largest reduction in the boundaries of protected land in US history, and changes to Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act protections.
And earlier this year, Trump announced regulatory changes to the National Environmental Policy Act, a change that will speed up approval of federal projects such as mines, highways, water infrastructure, and gas pipelines -- effectively weakening what's considered to be a landmark conservation law.

Medical services for migrants in Customs and Border Protection custody are at risk of lapsing unless the agency acts quickly to secure a new medical contract for the southwest border, according to a Department of Homeland Security inspector 
general alert.
The current contract for medical services will expire on September 29, leaving fewer than 30 days for the agency to take the necessary steps to ensure there isn't a lapse
 in medical services.
"A lapse in this contract could jeopardize the health and safety of migrants in CBP custody, as well as that of U.S. Border Patrol agents, CBP officers, and staff, 
especially during the current pandemic," the IG wrote. As of Thursday, CBP had not issued a solicitation for a new contract.
The watchdog issued its warning as a "management alert," which is reserved for urgent issues that require the immediate attention of agency leadership.
In response to the alert, CBP told the inspector general it plans to award a new two-year medical services contract on or about September 24.
Medical services for migrants, particularly for children, have been at the forefront during the Trump administration. Two children died in Border Patrol custody at 
the end of 2018 as the US was facing an increase in migrants arriving at the southern border. In the following months, the agency rushed to increase its medical capabilities for children and faced severe overcrowding in its facilities, which are designed for very short-term detention.
In response to the stark warning from the inspector general, CBP said the watchdog's concern was "misplaced," adding that pre-solicitation efforts are "well underway 
to ensure a timely FY 2020 award." The agency questioned why the inspector general would issue such an alert, "which in addition to being incorrect, is certain to cause unwarranted alarm and panic.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled a new list of potential Supreme Court nominees, a bluntly political move designed to keep conservatives 
from abandoning him, just as he used his first list in 2016 to entice conservatives to join him.
Speaking at the White House, Trump warned in hyperbolic terms of "radical justices" who would silence political speech rights; 
favor anarchists and rioters; and abolish religious liberties, including by obliterating "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance.
"Our cherished rights are at risk including the right to life and our great Second Amendment," said Trump, who opposes abortion rights and gun regulations.
Trump has predicted that the next president could fill several seats on the nine-member Supreme Court: "Maybe even five," he said at a recent New Hampshire appearance,
 adding, "You better vote for me."But his exaggerated claims and the revised list reflect more than the usual campaign crowing. They are a reminder of Trump's broader attempt to use and control the federal judiciary.
 His actions undermine the traditional neutrality of the bench. to read more ... <a href = "https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/politics/supreme-court-trump-judiciary-rule-of-law/index.html">please click here... </a>

President Donald Trump awarded the Medal of Honor on Friday to an Army Ranger who led a dramatic hostage rescue in Iraq in 2015.
The ceremony, taking place on the 19th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks, honored Sergeant Major Thomas Patrick Payne for successfully evacuating dozens of hostages being held by ISIS during a nighttime rescue mission in Kirkuk Province,
 Iraq, in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.
"He saved multiple hostages and he was the last man to leave. He wouldn't leave. No matter what they said, no matter who ordered him to do it, he wouldn't do it. He was the last one out,
" Trump said during the medal ceremony at the White House.
"It was one of the largest and most daring rescue missions in American history. Pat and his team rescued 75 captives and killed 20 ISIS terrorists. Pat, you embody the righteous glory of American valor. We stand in awe of your heroic, daring and gallant deeds," the President said.
 "You truly went above and beyond the call of duty to earn our nation's highest military honor."
Mass graves dug inside the compound had been spotted during surveillance, a US official with direct knowledge of details of the raid told CNN at the time. The firefight marked the first time US forces stepped into combat against ISIS in Iraq, one US official said in 2015.

The White House coronavirus task force placed a sharper focus on colleges and universities in its recommendations to states this week, pushing states to take measures to prevent further outbreaks as the school year begins.

CNN reached out to all 50 states for their weekly task force reports, which the White House has declined to make public, and obtained responses from 13 states as of saturday morning.
 Alabama was the only state to explicitly decline to provide its report. Other states referred CNN to other sources or did not respond.
This week's set of reports, sent to states Tuesday evening, was directed to governors and their senior staff, as well as health officials, emergency managers, epidemiologists, 
lab directors and preparedness directors for each state.
The reports are individually tailored to each state with information on cases and test positivity and county-specific data and broadly show concern about spread among institutes 
of higher education and mitigating cases in surrounding towns. The task force stressed that students who have been infected or exposed should isolate on campus and not return home.
