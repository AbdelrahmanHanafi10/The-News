            This month, Washington indicated that it might be willing to build a wall of its own by threatening

                The official request, published Thursday, states that NASA is willing to pay for samples between 50 and 500 grams — up to about a pound when weighed on Earth.
                 And NASA said the funds will be paid in full once companies can "provide imagery," proving the samples have been harvested and full
                  ownership of the samples is transferred to NASA, according to the announcement.

                    PUBG Corporation said in a statement on Tuesday that Tencent Games in India will no longer be authorized to publish
                     the mobile version of its PUBG franchise. The South Korean gaming company said it will take on all publishing responsibilities
                      itself within the country, where PUBG was the biggest grossing mobile game last month.
